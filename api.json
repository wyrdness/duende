      "full": "Duende (plural: duendes) are small humanoid creatures deeply embedded in Spanish and Latin American folklore. Typically described as 2-3 feet tall with the appearance of small old men, often wearing pointed hats and distinctive clothing, duendes exhibit a wide range of behaviors depending on regional traditions. In Spain, they are often depicted as house spirits—sometimes helpful, sometimes mischievous, hiding objects or causing minor domestic disturbances. In Mexico and Central America, duendes take on more sinister characteristics as forest dwellers who can kidnap children, curse families, or cause misfortune. Some traditions describe helpful house duendes who assist with chores if treated respectfully, while forest duendes are to be feared and avoided. The creatures serve important cultural functions as cautionary tales for children, explanations for missing objects or children, and as nature protectors. In modern times, duende beliefs remain active particularly in rural Latin America, with continued reports of encounters and sightings."
